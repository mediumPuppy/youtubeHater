# YouTubeHater Extension
This Chrome extension provides a simple yet powerful feature for YouTube users: It makes the extra stuff around the player disapper.

### Features
Remove Columns: Automatically detects and removes the "columns" div from all YouTube pages, ensuring a cleaner user interface.
Remove Secondary and Below: When viewing in a normal player it only deletes the "secondary" and "below" divs and keeps the player.

There are some issues with the UI occasionally, just submit an issue or a pull request and I can get it updated.
